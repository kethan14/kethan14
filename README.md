## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science graduate student with strong hands-on experience in **Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI systems**. My work focuses on building **end-to-end ML pipelines**, **LLM-powered applications**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems** with a strong emphasis on **semantic search, evaluation metrics, and explainability**.

I enjoy working on real-world datasets, benchmarking models rigorously, and developing systems that combine **modern NLP, vector databases, and deep learning** for practical decision-making and insights.
